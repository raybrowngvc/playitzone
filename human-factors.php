                                <p>"Human Factors" is a German psychological thriller film directed by Ronny Trocker, released in 2020. The movie delves into the complexities of human behavior, family dynamics, and the consequences of seemingly innocuous decisions. Set against the backdrop of a tranquil suburban landscape, "Human Factors" gradually unravels a tense narrative that explores the fragile nature of trust and perception.</p><p><strong>Plot Overview:</strong>
                                The film centers around a well-to-do family consisting of Nina, Jan, and their two children, Emma and Max. They lead a seemingly idyllic life in their modern suburban home. Jan, a successful consultant, is often preoccupied with work, while Nina juggles her own career with managing the household and their children's activities.</p><p>The tranquility of their existence is shattered when a series of unsettling events occur. One evening, their house is burglarized while they are sleeping. The family members are unharmed, but the incident leaves them feeling vulnerable and shaken. As they attempt to regain a sense of security, tensions within the family begin to surface.</p><p>The plot takes an intriguing turn when Jan becomes increasingly suspicious of their neighbor, Gregor, whom he believes may be involved in the burglary. Jan's paranoia intensifies as he becomes obsessed with uncovering the truth, leading him down a dark path of deception and manipulation.</p><p><strong>Themes:</strong>
